        Guild config
      </h3>
      <p>
        This page will help you set up the mmr commands for your server, as well as explain some of the other guild settings.
        Note that you must have the <code>MANAGE GUILD</code> permission to modify guild settings.
        <br><br>
        Here's a list of all the guild settings and a brief description of what they do
        <br><br>
        <code>GameBoards1</code> - The ID of a lounge on gb.hlorenzi.com.
        <br>
        <code>GameBoards2</code> - The ID of a lounge on gb.hlorenzi.com. This is for when you have a seperate leaderboard for rt's and ct's.
        <br>
        <code>Spreadsheet1</code> - The google spreadsheet ID of your server's leaderboard.
        <br>
        <code>Spreadsheet2</code> - The google spreadsheet ID of your server's leaderboard. This is for when you have a seperate leaderboard for rt's and ct's.
        <br>
        <code>SheetName</code> - The sheet name of the sheet with all player stats on your leaderboard. Defaults to <code>Leaderboard</code>
        <br>
        <code>RatingName</code> - The name of the points system your server uses. Defaults to <code>MMR</code>
        <br>
        <code>PlayerIndex</code> - The index of the column on your spreadsheet containing player names.
        <br>
        <code>RatingIndex</code> - The index of the column on your spreadsheet containing elo/mmr/point values.    
        <br>
        <code>StatIndexes</code> - The indexes of the columns on your spreadsheet you want to include for the <code>stats</code> command..
        <br>
      </p>
      <h3>
        Hlorenzi's Game Boards
      </h3>
      <p>
        If your leaderboard is on <a href="https://gb.hlorenzi.com" target="_blank">gb.hlorenzi.com</a>, then setting up the commands for it is very simple. All you need is the ID of your lounge.
        <br>
        First, get the link to your lounge. We'll use this one as an example:
        <br><br>
        <code>https://gb.hlorenzi.com/reg/gWsHAI/</code>
        <br><br>
        You'll want the letters after <code>/reg/</code>. So for this lounge, the ID would be:
        <br><br>
        <code>gWsHAI</code>
        <br><br>
        Once you have the ID, use the following command to set it in the guild settings (using your server's prefix): <code>/changesetting GameBoards1 gWsHAI</code>.
        <br><br>
        After you've set this up, you're all set! Both the <code>mmr</code> and <code>stats</code> commands should be working for your server.
        <br><br>
        If you have a 2 spreadsheets for rt's and ct's, follow the procedure above for the rt sheet, and do the same for the ct sheet, but use <code>GameBoards2</code> instead of <code>GameBoards1</code> in the command.
        You access the different leaderboards by doing <code>mmr rt/ct &ltplayer&gt</code>. Currently it is not possible to change the prefix for the two leaderboards from rt and ct.
        <br><br>
        It is important to note that the <code>GameBoards</code> guild setting takes priority over the <code>Spreadsheet</code> setting.
        So if you ever decide to switch to a Google Sheet leaderboard, reset both <code>GameBoards</code> settings with <code>set reset &ltsetting&gt</code>.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Google Sheets leaderboard
      </h3>
      <p>
        If your leaderboard is on a google sheet, it's a little more complicated to set up, so follow the steps below.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, you'll have to get the ID of the google spreadsheet that your leaderboard is on. To get it, first get the link to you spreadsheet, we'll use this one as an example:
        <br><br>
        <code>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPGK_kCgdqSLwcFjzgeLsRW7qV3MLCgcSBABdZHtK4o/edit?usp=sharing</code>
        <br><br>
        You'll want the part between the <code>/d/</code> and <code>/edit</code>. So for this spreadsheet, the ID would be:
        <br><br>
        <code>1IPGK_kCgdqSLwcFjzgeLsRW7qV3MLCgcSBABdZHtK4o</code>
        <br><br>
        Once you have the ID, use the following command to set it in the guild settings (using your server's prefix): <code>/changesetting Spreadsheet1 1IPGK_kCgdqSLwcFjzgeLsRW7qV3MLCgcSBABdZHtK4o</code>.
        <br><br>
        If you have a 2 spreadsheets for rt's and ct's, follow the procedure above for the rt sheet, and do the same for the ct sheet, but use <code>Spreadsheet2</code> instead of <code>Spreadsheet1</code> in the command.
        You access the different leaderboards by doing <code>mmr rt/ct &ltplayer&gt</code>. Currently it is not possible to change the prefix for the two leaderboards from rt and ct.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Setting the sheet name
      </h4>
      <p>
        Next, you'll want to setup the sheet name. This defaults to <code>Leaderboard</code>, so you may not have to change it. Let's take a look at a snippet from the leaderboard from the section above.
        <br>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/c20ca4a0-6883-4203-bdcc-2ac7bbd8dcc2%2F4e671b72-14e6-4db4-b1a5-d6aa03f730a1.image.png?v=1597869427129" style="height:75%;width:75%;">
        <br>
        The part underlined is what should be set as the sheet name. If it's not <code>Leaderboard</code>, run this command to change it to what it is: <code>/changesetting SheetName Leaderboard</code>.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Setting the player and rating index
      </h4>
      <p>
        Afterwards, you'll want to setup the <code>PlayerIndex</code> and <code>RatingIndex</code> settings. Let's look at a snippet of the leaderboard from the first section again.
        <br>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/c20ca4a0-6883-4203-bdcc-2ac7bbd8dcc2%2F2f86d7ba-6b64-4430-9e09-a0b728eb4b1a.image.png?v=1597868665597" style="height:75%;width:75%;">
        <br>
        In this leaderboard, the player names are on the 3rd column. When setting the index in the guild settings, you'll want to take the column that the player names/point values are on and subtract by 1.
        So in this example, you would do: <code>/changesetting PlayerIndex 2</code>.
        <br><br>
        This also applies for the column with the point values. Here, they're on the 4th column, so you would do: <code>/changesetting RatingIndex 3</code>.
        <br>
        Once these values are set up properly, the <code>mmr</code> command should now be fully working. If you would also like the stats command working, read the next section.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Setting the stat indexes
      </h4>
      <p>
        Finally, if you want the <code>stats</code> command working, you'll want to set the <code>StatIndexes</code> setting. These should be indexes seperated by commas. We'll take a look at the leaderboard from the previous sections again.
        <br>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/c20ca4a0-6883-4203-bdcc-2ac7bbd8dcc2%2F2f86d7ba-6b64-4430-9e09-a0b728eb4b1a.image.png?v=1597868665597" style="height:75%;width:75%;">
        <br>
        From this leaderboard, I would want columns B to K, except C since that's the player column (even if you include the player column in this setting, the bot will ignore it).
        <br>
        Column B is the 2nd column, so it's index would be 1. Column F is the 6th column, so it's index would be 5. Same goes for the rest of the columns. In this example, the command I would run would be: <code>/changesetting StatIndexes 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10</code>.
        <br>
        Once this setting is properly set, the <code>stats</code> command should be working.
      </p>
      <h4>
        End
      </h4>

        That's all for the tutorial on setting up the mmr commands for your server. If you still have any questions, please send me (Karthik#7144) a DM on discord (no need to friend me).
        If you feel something wasn't clear in the guide, please tell me so I can improve it for future users.
